## Short description
I went through w3school and express blog for refreshing my node and express knowledge. Then I went through Heroku documentation on the Node.js project deployment. I also watched some tutorials on youtube. Then I deployed a project following Heroku documentation. Then I started to work on my project. I created a homepage and 'About' routing page. i faced an issue while using ejs on the project. I took help from StackOverflow to fix the bugs. And finally, I solved the issue and added my HTTP request with the ejs HTML file. Then I deployed my project on GitHub and Heroku.
